Visualisation
=============
Saiku 2.5 has had a major overhaul of its visualisation options and here is some information about the latest features.

Spark charts
------------
Spark charts are small bar or line graphs displayed on the resultset to help show trends especially over time, design a query and select this option to see a small chart plot the data points.

Basic Statistics
----------------
Basic statistics is a small statistics addon that replaces the result set with a number of statistics about the members on columns. Min, Max, Sum, Average and Std Deviation are all covered.

Chart Types
-----------
Saiku 2.5 has a number of chart types, these are found by switching the mode on the right hand sidebar from Table to Chart. You can then select between:
